# Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to build a webpage using HTML and JS where we can view the data we were provided and filter it using 5 different filters to browse quickly through the data.

# Results
Combining the main components allows a web page to be rendered in which data can be transformed and cleanly displayed within a table. The JavaScript aspects allow users to have the ability to filter "back-end" data through the web page with function below:

* Date
* City
* State
* Country
* Shape

# Summary
As with any project, there are drawbacks that we came across process, one can be that we can have filters that are more useful to browse the data. We can use Filter Search for getting the information we need and nice design that can be easy to use for everyone.
